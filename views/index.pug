          | Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
          | knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their
          | society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed
          | knowledge,
          | values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond
          | skills that could
          | be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time
          | of the Middle
          | Kingdom.
